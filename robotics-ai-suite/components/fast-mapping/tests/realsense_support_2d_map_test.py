"""Test to verify FastMapping supports RealSense data for 2D mapping.

This a pytest-based test that validates:
1. FastMapping can process RealSense sensor data without crashing
2. The node can work with RViz 2D mapping configurations
3. Map data is published successfully when processing bag files

Test execution:
    pytest realsense_support_2d_map_test.py -v

Requirements:
    - ROS2 environment sourced
    - fast_mapping package built and available
    - ROS bag files with RealSense data at /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/bagfiles/spinning
